[green]‚úÖ How to resolve:[/]
1. Open [yellow]login.css[/] and resolve conflicts:
   - Keep your `position: absolute` change
   - Remove conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>

2. Save the file and mark as resolved:
   [yellow]git add login.css[/]

3. Commit the result:
   [yellow]git commit -m 'Merge: resolve conflict'[/]


[blue]üí° Why did this conflict happen?[/]
- You and your teammate both edited the [yellow]position[/] property in the same line.
- Since you didn't integrate their change on your branch before making your edit, Git can't automatically merge


[yellow]üí° Best Practices to Avoid Future Conflicts:[/]

1. [cyan]Always update before starting work:[/]
   - Before creating a new branch: 
        [yellow]git checkout {remote.remote_branch}
        git pull origin {remote.remote_branch}[/]
   - This ensures you're working with the latest code

2. [cyan]Regularly merge {remote.remote_branch} into your branch:[/]
   - While working on your feature:
        [yellow]git checkout {current_branch}
        git merge {remote.remote_branch}[/]
   - This catches conflicts early when they're smaller

3. [cyan]Communicate with teammates:[/]
   - Let your team know what files you're working on
   - Coordinate on shared files

4. [cyan]Smaller, focused changes:[/]
   - Make smaller PRs with focused changes
   - Avoid large, long-running branches

5. [cyan]Consider [yellow]rebase[/] workflow:[/]
   - Instead of merging, you can rebase:
        [yellow]git checkout {current_branch}
        git rebase {remote.remote_branch}[/]
   
   - This rewrites your history to apply your changes *after* {remote.remote_branch}'s latest commits
   - It helps avoid messy merge commits


[magenta]üí° Bonus Tip:[/]
In a future scenario, you'll face a similar conflict ‚Äî
but you'll solve it using [yellow]git rebase[/] instead of merge.

This helps keep your history linear and cleaner ‚Äî and teaches another powerful Git technique.
